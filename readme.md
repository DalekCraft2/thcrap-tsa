This Git repo contains a number of patches which were previously developed using the MediaWiki on [Touhou Patch Center] (http://thpatch.net/). These have been moved to Git to get rid of the unnecessary MediaWiki wrappers around the actual thcrap formats, and thus to ease their development.

Note that this is, as of now, not a complete, standalone thcrap repository, but merely a *part* of `thpatch` that is regularly pulled into its directory structure.
